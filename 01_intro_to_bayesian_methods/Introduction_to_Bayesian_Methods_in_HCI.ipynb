    "Bayesian methods have application throughout virtually of all of HCI, but are often only encountered in a few specialised niches; for example in speech recognition. There are a wide variety of areas where Bayesian methods can be directly *used* in HCI, three of the most well-explored being:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bayesian methods in empirical analysis** (i.e. Bayesian statistics for analysing experimental work): Bayesian analysis offers a potentially superior way of analysing some kinds of quantitative experimental work that arise in HCI. It can directly answer questions of interest and can incorporate first-principles models from domain experts. There are opportunities for novel experimental designs (e.g. online Bayesian experimental design) and meta-analyses. The advance of easy-to-use packages for Bayesian inference (e.g. Stan, brms) makes relatively sophisticated inference models practical for researchers. (**\"Statistical Rethinking\" by Richard McElreath** is recommended reading as a non-HCI specific elementary introduction to Bayesian data analysis)\n",

This is typically the case in optimisation with observations from users, who are expensive to measure, noisy and not governed by simple mathematical formulae. This can range from simple Bayesian A/B testing to sophisticated modelling of user behaviour at a fine level of granularity. Bayesian optimisation can be applied to a huge range of problems with expensive or noisy functions, from inferring subjective preferences to optimising touch sensor configurations. Proxy models like Gaussian Processes are well-supported by software tools.\n",

This can be used to derive robust models based around inference of intention. Strong prior models of what we expect users to do allow us to extract maximum value from user actions and preserve and use uncertainty about user intent. This is a philosophy of interaction founded in the idea of the interface as a concentrator of belief, whose mechanics are driven by the logic of probability.\n",

    "We'll specifically look at probabilistic filtering, which is just Bayesian updating over time. There are a collection of algorithms for doing so efficiently.  Probabilistic filtering **(PF)** tracks the evolution of some unknown variables *[user intentions]* given observed evidence *[user input]*, in a way that is **robust**. Probabilistic filters infer a **distribution** over possible hidden (unobserved) variables, updating them over time. These filters are:\n",
    "* inherently **uncertain**, as they represent degrees of belief as probability distributions over states\n",

    "|**Bayesian**  |  Represents degrees of belief using probability distributions.    |\n",
    "|**predictive**  |  Works by comparing predictions with reality.   |\n",
    "|**generative** |  Involves generating (i.e. simulating) behaviour.   |\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering is an **inverse probability** approach, and it requires that we think of interaction from an unique perspective. We have to explicitly be able to write down:\n",
    "\n",
    "* what we want to know (i.e. the **state space of intentions and world states**), which describes hidden states that might give rise to observed behaviour;\n",
    "* how that will change over time (i.e. the **state dynamics** of our model);\n",
    "*  a model that *if we knew what the user intention was, what the expected behaviour would be* (i.e. a **generative function mapping intention -> expected observations**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is the **inverse** of the typical way of approaching this problem, where we would try and find a mapping from a sensors to intention, by design or by learning. Instead, we propose that we can postulate intentions, and look for evidence that might favour some underlying intentions over others. This can be a subtle and powerful way of distinguishing intentions which are poorly represented in observed signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation viewpoint\n",
    "These filters are really *simulators*. They *simulate* how possible user behaviours might unfold over time. In some probabilistic filters, hundreds of parallel simulators are run, each with slightly different parameters. In all cases, the simulations are adjusted online to better match observed reality. The internal parameters that drive the simulation are the *unknown variables* we want to infer and the *evidence* is the observed reality that adjusts the simulation parameters.\n"

    "### Why are probabilistic filters computational HCI?\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering means writing down an **executable, statistical model** of user behaviour, then **running an inference algorithm** that updates beliefs based on the way observations evolve. The **parameters** of the filter can be **learned from user data**. The effectiveness of the filter can be quantitatively **instrumented** and measured."

    "\n",
    "We can show a simple example using a **particle filtering** algorithm. Imagine trying to estimate the altitude of a plane attempting to land near an airstrip. We receive radar altitude measurements; these are inaccurate. We have a rough idea of how high the plane might be when it starts (it's not likely to be trying to land from 10 km up), and very rough idea of how much it could plausibly move from one measurement to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can define ways of sampling from these distributions, we can approximate a belief with a collection of samples. We can then update our beliefs (approximately) by \"copying\" samples from one time step to the next which correspond to more likely states. This turns out to be a well-founded algorithm for Bayesian estimation."

    "\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering has a number of motivating properties that make it worth studying:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stronger modelling\n",
    "* **Easy to incorporate priors** Prior knowledge is naturally and easily expressed. We write down a \"simulator\" that behaves  according to mechanics we can arbitrarily define and can build upon what we know about the world.\n",
    "* **Flexible modelling** PFs can incorporate both fundamental modelling (e.g. physiological or cognitive models) and data-driven machine learning.\n",
    "* **Easy to balance modelling with learning** We can fuse both learned components with prior models, either to efficiently emulate complex processes via learned surrogates, or to capture models for which we lack strong first-principles views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robust\n",
    "* **Robustness to noise** PFs can work well even with input sensors that are noisy.\n",
    "* **Robustness to poorly specified models** PFs can cope predictably even if our models are bad.\n",
    "* **Robustness to intermittence** PFs can continue to sensibly interpolate when input cuts out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoupled\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decoupled from real-time** PFs can infer past (smoothing), present (filtering) and future (forecasting).\n",
    "* **Inherent fusion of multiple input sensors** PFs are often used to solely to fuse together multiple inputs from different sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective\n",
    "* **Uncertainty estimates** PFs *know how certain they are* and this can be used in the interaction design.\n",
    "* **Better feedback** PFs  offer the opportunity to give users rich insight into the process of intention decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drawbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computational demands can be heavy, especially compared to black box prediction models.\n",
    "* Speeding up inference may require more sophisticated statistical models, and this can get tricky quickly.\n",
    "* If you **don't** have good models, then it may be easier to just learn from data, or force users to adapt to a design.\n",
    "* Distributions are not natural for users. Representing these so users understand what is going on can be tricky.\n",

Evidence is observed, and a posterior is computed; this becomes the prior for the next step, after a **prediction** step is used to align the prior with the known or estimated behaviour. Unlike other filters, such filters maintain a **distribution** over some hidden variable we are trying to estimate. This makes it possible for them to cope with noise and uncertainty robustly. It also (slightly) complicates their implementation, but their are good models which are readily available.\n",

    "* **Dealt with intermittency**: decoupled from real-time state, because our model has internal dynamics. We don't need continuous observations. We can predict the future just as easily as the current state.\n",
    "* **Represented uncertainty**: we know when control is good and when it is bad, and we can both use this for decision making and we can display it to the user to offer a potentially more transparent interface.\n",
    "* **Decoded discrete outputs**: we have inferred continuous states, then mapped to a 1 of N choice.\n",
    "* **Fused multiple sensors**: we combined the occasional, precise position measurement with continuous, ambiguous and noisy speed measurement. It is trivial to combine sensors because of our inverse approach -- we simply map our internal states out onto multiple observation channels and then compare for similarity.\n",
    "* **Inferred hidden states**: we never observed velocity at all, but we were able to update our distribution over possible values regardless. This is a very simple example, but it shows how we can identify plausible states of hidden variables."

    "Bayesian methods have application throughout virtually of all of HCI, but are often only encountered in a few specialised niches; for example in speech recognition. There are a wide variety of areas where Bayesian methods can be directly *used* in HCI, three of the most well-explored being:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bayesian methods in empirical analysis** (i.e. Bayesian statistics for analysing experimental work): Bayesian analysis offers a potentially superior way of analysing some kinds of quantitative experimental work that arise in HCI. It can directly answer questions of interest and can incorporate first-principles models from domain experts. There are opportunities for novel experimental designs (e.g. online Bayesian experimental design) and meta-analyses. The advance of easy-to-use packages for Bayesian inference (e.g. Stan, brms) makes relatively sophisticated inference models practical for researchers. (**\"Statistical Rethinking\" by Richard McElreath** is recommended reading as a non-HCI specific elementary introduction to Bayesian data analysis)\n",

This is typically the case in optimisation with observations from users, who are expensive to measure, noisy and not governed by simple mathematical formulae. This can range from simple Bayesian A/B testing to sophisticated modelling of user behaviour at a fine level of granularity. Bayesian optimisation can be applied to a huge range of problems with expensive or noisy functions, from inferring subjective preferences to optimising touch sensor configurations. Proxy models like Gaussian Processes are well-supported by software tools.\n",

This can be used to derive robust models based around inference of intention. Strong prior models of what we expect users to do allow us to extract maximum value from user actions and preserve and use uncertainty about user intent. This is a philosophy of interaction founded in the idea of the interface as a concentrator of belief, whose mechanics are driven by the logic of probability.\n",

    "We'll specifically look at probabilistic filtering, which is just Bayesian updating over time. There are a collection of algorithms for doing so efficiently.  Probabilistic filtering **(PF)** tracks the evolution of some unknown variables *[user intentions]* given observed evidence *[user input]*, in a way that is **robust**. Probabilistic filters infer a **distribution** over possible hidden (unobserved) variables, updating them over time. These filters are:\n",
    "* inherently **uncertain**, as they represent degrees of belief as probability distributions over states\n",

    "|**Bayesian**  |  Represents degrees of belief using probability distributions.    |\n",
    "|**predictive**  |  Works by comparing predictions with reality.   |\n",
    "|**generative** |  Involves generating (i.e. simulating) behaviour.   |\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering is an **inverse probability** approach, and it requires that we think of interaction from an unique perspective. We have to explicitly be able to write down:\n",
    "\n",
    "* what we want to know (i.e. the **state space of intentions and world states**), which describes hidden states that might give rise to observed behaviour;\n",
    "* how that will change over time (i.e. the **state dynamics** of our model);\n",
    "*  a model that *if we knew what the user intention was, what the expected behaviour would be* (i.e. a **generative function mapping intention -> expected observations**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is the **inverse** of the typical way of approaching this problem, where we would try and find a mapping from a sensors to intention, by design or by learning. Instead, we propose that we can postulate intentions, and look for evidence that might favour some underlying intentions over others. This can be a subtle and powerful way of distinguishing intentions which are poorly represented in observed signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation viewpoint\n",
    "These filters are really *simulators*. They *simulate* how possible user behaviours might unfold over time. In some probabilistic filters, hundreds of parallel simulators are run, each with slightly different parameters. In all cases, the simulations are adjusted online to better match observed reality. The internal parameters that drive the simulation are the *unknown variables* we want to infer and the *evidence* is the observed reality that adjusts the simulation parameters.\n"

    "### Why are probabilistic filters computational HCI?\n",
    "Probabilistic filtering means writing down an **executable, statistical model** of user behaviour, then **running an inference algorithm** that updates beliefs based on the way observations evolve. The **parameters** of the filter can be **learned from user data**. The effectiveness of the filter can be quantitatively **instrumented** and measured."

    "\n",
    "We can show a simple example using a **particle filtering** algorithm. Imagine trying to estimate the altitude of a plane attempting to land near an airstrip. We receive radar altitude measurements; these are inaccurate. We have a rough idea of how high the plane might be when it starts (it's not likely to be trying to land from 10 km up), and very rough idea of how much it could plausibly move from one measurement to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can define ways of sampling from these distributions, we can approximate a belief with a collection of samples. We can then update our beliefs (approximately) by \"copying\" samples from one time step to the next which correspond to more likely states. This turns out to be a well-founded algorithm for Bayesian estimation."

    "## **Crafted mappings**\n",
    "**where we try to find (by hand) transforms from sensors to intentions that are  simple or obvious.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** a button, which has two physical states, and maps on to two intentional states via two electrical states. Pushed down = current flows = user intended to switch on. The mapping from electrical states to intentional states is **designed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is is explicit design, which often puts the burden of mapping states <=> intentions on the user. Users have to learn to encode their intentions in physical actions which hopefully correspond \"intuitively\" with the crafted mappings that have been set up to detect them.\n",

    "## **Machine learned mappings**\n",
    "**where we train a system to recognize a class of input patterns as being representative of an intended behaviour.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Finger gesture recogniser; hundreds of examples of many users performing one of N multi-touch gestures are recorded. These are used to train a random forest to classify the intended gesture. The mapping from electrical states (capacitive sensors) to intentional states is **learned**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces the burden on the user to learn a specific mapping and instead adapts to behaviours exhibited by real users with real input devices. But it can suffer with issues in generalisation and robustness, and is often very hard to combine with known first-principles models (e.g. users can't change the size of their fingers!)\n",

Unlike other filters, such filters maintain a **distribution** over some hidden variable we are trying to estimate. This makes it possible for them to cope with noise and uncertainty robustly.

    "* **Dealt with intermittency**: decoupled from real-time state, because our model has internal dynamics. We don't need continuous observations. We can predict the future just as easily as the current state.\n",
    "* **Represented uncertainty**: we know when control is good and when it is bad, and we can both use this for decision making and we can display it to the user to offer a potentially more transparent interface.\n",
    "* **Decoded discrete outputs**: we have inferred continuous states, then mapped to a 1 of N choice.\n",
    "* **Fused multiple sensors**: we combined the occasional, precise position measurement with continuous, ambiguous and noisy speed measurement. It is trivial to combine sensors because of our inverse approach -- we simply map our internal states out onto multiple observation channels and then compare for similarity.\n",
    "* **Inferred hidden states**: we never observed velocity at all, but we were able to update our distribution over possible values regardless. This is a very simple example, but it shows how we can identify plausible states of hidden variables."
